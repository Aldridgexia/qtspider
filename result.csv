They seem to be really serious about your GRE score and they're impatient for applicant's improvements. I have another GRE test on Nov.25 and got V162 Q170 AW3.5,but they replied that they're not interested in. They have an requirement of AW to be over 4, but I have also seen admissions to those who have only 3. So I guess applicants should take it easy.

NYU was overall very unresponsive to my communication. They also said my Caltech transcript was not legible, yet they require an upload size of only like 100kb. I sent another copy and they never acknowledged receipt of it. I was not happy with my application experience with them and would have turned them down had they miraculously decided to admit me.

A bizarre admit conditional on taking MAT477 or equivalent (Basic Probability and Statistics) before September 2010, either online or at a local college.  Bizarre because I have been out of school since 2001, and have taken courses on Bayesian inference and Regression, but have no Basic Probability Course since I was given AP credit from I.B. HL exams.  Admission screens seem disorganized, and not consistent or thorough.

I did not get a response for a very long time and was told that they were missing a letter of recommendation when I called to inquire.  I don't know if my app was ever really looked at. Lesson:  Keep on top of NYU even if their electronic system tells you everything was received.

The admission process was really smooth, even though I had applied in the final rounds, just before the deadline, everything was scheduled promptly. Also, the ISSC was very co-operative in expediting the mailing of the I-20 for immigration/visa.
